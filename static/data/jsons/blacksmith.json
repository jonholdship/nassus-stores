	"description": "<p>Gisela's workshop is a mess. Armour parts and sword hilts lean precariously against the furnace, whose intense radiance assaults you when you get too close, but the gentle breeze felt from Gisela's carefully constructed ventilation keeps things comfortable. Dozens of trinkets in various states of disrepair lie on the gnome-sized workbenches at the back, along with a well-worn array of fine tools, and a suspiciously lumpy pile of canvas.</p><p>Gisela is to one side, casting yet more nails for the town's ever-growing expansion. Her blueish skin shows a sweat, despite the breeze. She glances up as you enter, but doesn't acknowledge you until a sufficiently awkward silence has passed.</p>",
