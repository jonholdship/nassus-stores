	"description": "<p>Lady Pravira is tall. Despite her intimidating size, she’s a very warm and welcoming woman who takes great pleasure in providing a hub for the town through her shop.</p><p> As well as her immense height and strong build, she is characterised by her blue-green skin, long orange hair, and sophisticated dresses. She’ll often keep a small bouquet of flower behind her ear or in her hair, and whenever she walks about town she can be spotted wearing a wide-brimmed white hat.</p>",
